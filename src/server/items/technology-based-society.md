Technology Based Society

We pledge to bring about a technological revolution across all
sectors. A country cannot progress without adapting to the
rapid technological changes taking place. It is with this in mind
that our policies will create the environment required to develop
the IT competencies and language skills of future generations,
in order to enable them to conquer global markets.
