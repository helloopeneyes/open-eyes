People Centric Economic Development

We pledge to develop a people centric economic model
whereby every citizen of this country can participate and
take pride in the work they do as every job is required for
the progress of this country. The thrust of our growth model
will be focused on promoting agriculture and fisheries to
become global players. This will be done through incentivizing
entrepreneurs and infusing new technology to enhance
production and productivity.
