Sustainable Environmental Management

It is our pledge to ensure that the environment is protected in all
our development plans. This will ensure that future generations
are handed over a country that is not polluted. We shall bring
about amendments to existing laws, and if necessary new
legislation will be introduced in order to strengthen and protect
our forest cover, rivers, streams and wildlife.
